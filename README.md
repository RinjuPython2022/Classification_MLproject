# Classification_MLproject
 The diabetes dataset is a binary classification problem where it needs to be analysed whether a patient is suffering from the disease or not on the basis of many available features in the dataset. Different methods and procedures of cleaning the data, feature extraction, feature engineering and algorithms to predict are used  for diagnostic measure Diabetes Dataset.
  Diabetes dataset has 9 attributes in total. All the person in records are females and the number of pregnancies they have had has been recorded as the first attribute of the dataset. Second is the value of glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test and then is the Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), fourth in line is the Triceps skin fold thickness (mm), then is the 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml), sixth is Body mass index (weight in kg/ (height in m) ^2) and then seventh is the Diabetes pedigree function and the second last value is the that of the Age (years). The ninth column is that of the Outcome variable (0 or 1), 0 for no diabetes and 1 for the presence. To start with we first take a description of the dataset. We infer not much from this except the facts like we have a data datset of 768 lines.  We also calculated the number of datsets that were positive to the test of diabetes and those who were negetive and the value came out to be 268 and 500 respectively.
